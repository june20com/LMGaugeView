LMGaugeView
==============
This version of LMGaugeView is a  fork by June20. The code was originally forked to allow an `NSNumberFormatter` to be used to customize the formatting of the numeric reading in the middle of the gauge. Subsequently, additional code improvements were also made.

LMGaugeView is a simple and customizable gauge control for iOS inspired by [Flavor](https://dribbble.com/flavor) sketch on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/1217274-Speedometer-Day-Night-Mode).
